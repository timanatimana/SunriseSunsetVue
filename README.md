# SunriseSunsetVue

Simple frontend with Vue 3 and Typescript. It consumes a .NET backend [SunriseSunset.NET](https://github.com/timanatimana/SunriseSunset.NET).
State is managed with composables `.\composables\useSunriseSunset.ts` and `C:\Users\Angelika\source\repos\SunriseSunsetVue\src\composables\useLocation.ts`.
[Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is used as a HTTP Client. Tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Try it out live

I deployed this project on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 
Have a look and try it out: [SunriseSunsetVue - Live](https://sunrise-sunset-vue.netlify.app).

## React version

I created a React frontend with the same functionality. Have a look at [SunriseSunsetReact](https://github.com/timanatimana/SunriseSunsetReact).
